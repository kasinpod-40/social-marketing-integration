## Unreleased — Facebook Organic observed aggregation + live rematerialization — 2026-08-21

### Shared Organic aggregation repair

- Fixed Shared Organic aggregation so authoritative `complete` / `revisable` source coverage no longer lets a few historical metric-specific null members erase otherwise observed Likes, Comments, Shares and Engagement totals.
- Preserved source and row-level null evidence: row Engagement remains strict, period observed subtotals require authoritative source coverage plus complete baseline coverage, and partial/unproven coverage remains fail-closed.
- Preserved observed zero and signed negative corrections; no missing metric is converted to zero.
- PR #662 merged the calculation repair to `main` at `0d8cac334405d755a108f2adea65e9cc6f4cd646` after full Branch Verification.

### Exact-runtime-preserving Integration rollout

- Added a narrow Facebook Organic 1D/3D/7D/30D rematerialization operator that reuses the existing Shared Report/D1/Lark/Queue/deployment primitives instead of creating a Facebook-specific Report engine.
- The operator captures the active Worker `MKT_*_ENABLED` vector, deploys current `main` with that vector preserved exactly, and temporarily enables only the two existing Shared Report execution flags when required.
- Refresh is stable-ID-only and D1-backed. It performs zero Facebook Provider refetch, zero manual Lark patch, one private D1 backup before Queue mutation, bounded D1↔Lark verification for every window, and exact runtime-flag restoration after execution.
- Recorded deploy/send attempts block blind rerun. Recovery may restore the exact captured runtime and verify completed reports, but sends zero Queue jobs.
- Repository implementation is PR #663. Pre-closure Branch Verification run `32446106165`, job `96665851523`, passed syntax/architecture/hygiene, focused regressions, full Unit + Workers runtime, Report reliability, dependency audit, Wrangler dry-run and diff check.
- Customer-owned Production and PR #661 remain out of scope with zero mutation.
